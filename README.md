# Unveiling-the-Black-Box-Deciphering-ML-Explainability-with-Statlog-Heart-Data

The goal of this repository is to explore various Explainable AI (XAI) methods on models trained on an classification task on the UCI ML - Statlog (Heart) Data Set.


## Description

"Unveiling the Black Box" is a comprehensive exploration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods applied to machine learning models. In this project, we aim to shed light on the inner workings of machine learning models and enhance their interpretability. We focus on the Statlog (Heart) Data Set, leveraging XAI techniques to understand and explain model predictions related to heart disease diagnosis.

3. Open the notebook `explainer.ipynb` to see examples of XAI methods applied to the Statlog (Heart) Data Set.


## Explainable AI (XAI) Methods

In this project, we explore several XAI methods, including but not limited to:

- LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- Interpretable Decision Trees
- Feature Importance Visualization

We discuss the significance of each method and demonstrate how they are applied to enhance model interpretability.

## Data Set

The Statlog (Heart) Data Set is utilized in this project. It contains [describe the data, its attributes, and source]. We provide preprocessing details in the notebooks.
